Our legend begins in 2011 when founder Justin Adkins started tinkering and publishing apps for the Windows Phone platform as Adkins Software Development.

Eventually, a friend suggested that the company needed a shorter and catchier name. Since taking mythology in high School, Justin maintained a strong fascination with the Greek Gods and Goddesses; He even had adopted the practice of giving projects Greek codenames (e.g. Ares, Hephaestus, etc.) He decided to embrace his inner nerd; With that, MythCoders was born!

To this day, MythCoders continues to be a one-man band.
